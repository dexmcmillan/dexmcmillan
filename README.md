# üëã Hello/bonjour!

## About me
I'm Dexter (he/him), currently working as an Associate Producer with the network digital graphics team at CBC News in Toronto, ON, Canada. I'm a Datawrapper enthusiast, and enjoy hacking it to do all sorts of cool stuff. I'm a former Javascript/node.js developer who's in love with Python. I love telling visual stories with data and graphics.

Assorted data I'm working with can be found at the [cbc-data](https://github.com/dexmcmillan/cbc-data) repository, and I'm always happy to have contributions to the [Datawrapper Graphics](https://github.com/dexmcmillan/datawrappergraphics) library I'm building. The inner workings of live charts I've build for CBC News can be found in my [cbc-datawrapperscripts](https://github.com/dexmcmillan/cbc-datawrapperscripts) repository.

You can find many of my best visualizations on [my portfolio](http://dextermcmillan.com/), which I designed and built myself using Vue.js.

- üìù<b>Currently working on</b>: [a Python library to work with Datawrapper maps and charts](https://github.com/dexmcmillan/datawrappergraphics), including a class to live-update locator maps.
- ü¶ü<b>Fun fact</b>: I'm on a lifelong mission to find out [how many mosquitoes it would take to kill you](https://github.com/dexmcmillan/mosquito-question/blob/main/mosquito.ipynb).
- üå±<b>Currently learning</b>: How to generate better docs with Sphinx.
- üè¢<b>Currently looking</b>: For opportunities! If you have work related to data analysis or visualization, newsroom software development, or Datawrapper, get in touch on twitter at [@dexmcmillan](https://twitter.com/dexmcmillan) or by [email](mailto:dexmcmillan@gmail.com).
