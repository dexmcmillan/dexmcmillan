### Hi there! I'm Dexter.

I currently an Associate Producer with the network digital graphics team at CBC News in Toronto, ON, Canada. By day, I process data to produce graphics on [CBCNews.ca](https://www.cbc.ca/news?). I'm also a Datawrapper enthusiast, and enjoy hacking it to do all sorts of cool stuff. I'm a former node.js developer who's in love with Python.

Assorted visualizations I'm working on can be found at the [cbc-data](https://github.com/dexmcmillan/cbc-data) repository.

- 📝Currently working on: a Python library to work with Datawrapper maps and charts, including a class to live-update locator maps.
- ⚡Fun fact: I'm trained as a journalist, with a Master of Journalism from Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: How to generate better docs with Sphinx.
