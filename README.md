### 👋 Hello/bonjour!

## About me
I'm Dexter (he/him), currently working as an Associate Producer with the network digital graphics team at CBC News in Toronto, ON, Canada. By day, I process data to produce graphics on [CBCNews.ca](https://www.cbc.ca/news?). I'm also a Datawrapper enthusiast, and enjoy hacking it to do all sorts of cool stuff. I'm a former Javascript/node.js developer who's in love with Python. I love telling visual stories with data and graphics.

Assorted data I'm working with can be found at the [cbc-data](https://github.com/dexmcmillan/cbc-data) repository, and I'm always happy to have contributions to the [Datawrapper Graphics](https://github.com/dexmcmillan/datawrappergraphics) library I'm building. The inner workings of live charts I've build for CBC News can be found in my [cbc-datawrapperscripts](https://github.com/dexmcmillan/cbc-datawrapperscripts) repository.

- 📝Currently working on: a Python library to work with Datawrapper maps and charts, including a class to live-update locator maps.
- ⚡Fun fact: I'm trained as a journalist, with a Master of Journalism from Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada.
- 🌱I’m currently learning: How to generate better docs with Sphinx.
- 🏢I'm currently looking: For opportunities! Get in touch on twitter at [@dexmcmillan](https://twitter.com/dexmcmillan).
