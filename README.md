# üëã Hello/bonjour!

## About me
I'm Dexter (he/him), an investigative data journalist with CBC Marketplace, based in Toronto, ON, Canada. I work primarily in Python, but occasionally work with Javascript as the need arises.

## Awards
- [**Excellence in Data Storytelling, RTDNA Awards, 2022**](https://rtdnacanada.com/2022-national/2022-digital-award-winners-national/) - I did the graphics for [this fantastic data story](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/warning-signs-intimate-partner-homicide-1.6269761) by my colleagues at CBC's investigative unit.
